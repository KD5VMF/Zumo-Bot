# Zumo Robot Autonomous Navigation

This project implements an autonomous navigation system for the Zumo Robot using the Zumo Shield. The robot is designed to navigate around obstacles by detecting collisions and executing random turn patterns to avoid them. The code also includes adjustments to balance the motor speeds to ensure the robot drives straight.

## Features

- **Collision Detection**: Uses the onboard accelerometer to detect collisions with obstacles.
- **Random Turn Patterns**: Executes one of twenty random turn patterns upon detecting a collision.
- **Motor Balancing**: Adjusts motor speeds to correct for drift and ensure straight driving.
- **Sound Effects**: Plays a sound effect upon collision detection.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- Zumo Robot with Zumo Shield
- USB cable for connecting the Zumo Robot to your computer

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/zumo-robot-navigation.git
   ```

2. **Open the Arduino IDE**:
   - Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to `File` > `Open...`.
   - Select the `zumo-robot-navigation.ino` file from the cloned repository.

3. **Select the Board and Port**:
   - Go to `Tools` > `Board` and select `Arduino/Genuino Uno`.
   - Go to `Tools` > `Port` and select the correct port for your Arduino.

4. **Upload the Code**:
   - Click the `Upload` button to upload the code to your Zumo Robot.

### Usage

Once the code is uploaded, the Zumo Robot will start navigating autonomously without waiting for a button press. It will move forward, detect collisions, and execute random turn patterns to avoid obstacles.

## Code Overview

The main components of the code include:

- **Accelerometer Settings**: Configures the accelerometer for collision detection.
- **Motor Settings**: Configures the motor speeds and includes adjustments for motor balancing.
- **Collision Detection**: Checks for collisions using the accelerometer and responds by executing random turn patterns.
- **Random Turn Patterns**: Defines twenty different turn patterns that the robot can execute upon collision detection.
- **Motor Balancing**: Adjusts the motor speeds to correct for drift and ensure straight driving.
